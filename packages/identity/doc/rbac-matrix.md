# Verdex RBAC Permission Matrix

A tick (✓) means the role holds that permission; a dash (–) means it
does not.

## Design notes

* Roles are additive. A user holding both `judge` and `clerk` has the
  union of both permission sets.
* `admin` does not imply judicial authority. An admin cannot issue case
  decisions (`case:sign_off`) unless they also hold the `judge` role.
* `auditor` is intentionally read-only across all dimensions. It cannot
  modify any data.
* `advocate` cannot schedule hearings — that is an administrative
  function performed by a clerk or judge.
* The permission matrix is enforced at runtime by
  `identity.HasPermission` and the `RequirePermission` HTTP middleware.
  The database layer (Row-Level Security, Phase 005) provides a
  second defence-in-depth layer against cross-tenant data access.
* `keys:manage` and `keys:break_glass` (Phase 076,
  `packages/keymanagement`) are admin-only by design: key rotation/
  revocation and emergency break-glass access are the highest-blast-
  radius operations in the system and are deliberately not delegated
  to any other role. `auditor` holds `keys:view` (metadata only, never
  key material) consistent with its read-only, compliance-facing
  posture elsewhere in this matrix.
* `privacy:manage` (Phase 081, `packages/privacy`) is admin-only:
  processing a subject-access or right-to-erasure request, or
  recording a consent/legal-basis change, is a data-subject-rights
  action with real legal consequences and is deliberately not
  delegated beyond the tenant administrator. `auditor` holds
  `privacy:view` (read-only access to the data inventory, retention
  report, and privacy audit trail) consistent with its compliance-
  facing posture elsewhere in this matrix.
* `compliance:manage` (Phase 082, `packages/compliance`) is
  admin-only: registering/updating a catalogued control, recording
  control evidence, and setting a tenant's compliance profile are
  administrative actions that shape what a compliance report and gap
  analysis certify. `auditor` holds `compliance:view` (read-only
  access to the control catalogue, a tenant's compliance profile,
  collected evidence, gap-analysis reports, and the compliance
  dashboard) consistent with its compliance-facing posture elsewhere
  in this matrix.
* `threatmodel:manage` (Phase 083, `packages/threatmodel`) is
  admin-only: transitioning a catalogued mitigation's status (e.g.
  Planned -> Implemented -> Verified) is an administrative attestation
  that a real control has been checked and works, and is deliberately
  not delegated beyond the tenant administrator. `auditor` holds
  `threatmodel:view` (read-only access to the STRIDE threat catalogue
  and a mitigation's recorded status-transition history) consistent
  with its read-only, compliance-facing posture elsewhere in this
  matrix.
* `vulnmanagement:manage` (Phase 084, `packages/vulnmanagement`) is
  admin-only: recording a scanner finding, triaging it, and
  transitioning its remediation status (including deciding to accept
  risk or mark a finding a false positive) are administrative
  decisions with real security consequences, and are deliberately not
  delegated beyond the tenant administrator. `auditor` holds
  `vulnmanagement:view` (read-only access to findings, triage decision
  history, and SLA-breach reports) consistent with its read-only,
  compliance-facing posture elsewhere in this matrix.
* `backupdr:manage` (Phase 085, `packages/backupdr`) is admin-only:
  setting a tenant's backup policy per data class, recording a backup,
  and executing a restore drill are administrative actions that shape
  this platform's actual disaster-recovery posture, and are
  deliberately not delegated beyond the tenant administrator. `auditor`
  holds `backupdr:view` (read-only access to backup policies, backup
  record history, restore-drill history, and RPO/RTO evaluation
  results) consistent with its read-only, compliance-facing posture
  elsewhere in this matrix.
* `integration:manage` (Phase 087, `packages/integration`) is
  admin-only: registering a connector configuration, setting connector
  credentials, and triggering an inbound case import or outbound
  report delivery are the highest-blast-radius operations this package
  exposes -- they reach an external court case-management system --
  and are deliberately not delegated beyond the tenant administrator.
  `auditor` holds `integration:view` (read-only access to connector
  configurations minus credential material, import/delivery run
  history, and reconciliation results) consistent with its read-only,
* `securitytesting:manage` (Phase 086, `packages/securitytesting`) is
  admin-only: recording a finding, running an adversarial scenario
  against production defenses, and verifying remediation are actions
  with real security consequences, and are deliberately not delegated
  beyond the tenant administrator. `auditor` holds
  `securitytesting:view` (read-only access to findings, run records,
  and remediation history) consistent with its read-only,
  compliance-facing posture elsewhere in this matrix.
* `bulkimport:manage` (Phase 088, `packages/bulkimport`) is admin-only:
  registering an import job, running batches against a historical
  case-corpus source, pausing/resuming a job, and rolling back a
  completed or failed job are administrative bulk-data operations with
  real downstream effects on the tenant's case records, and are
  deliberately not delegated beyond the tenant administrator. `auditor`
  holds `bulkimport:view` (read-only access to import job history,
  per-record outcomes, and progress) consistent with its read-only,
* `corpusupdater:manage` (Phase 089, `packages/corpusupdater`) is
  admin-only: staging an amendment, validating/applying a corpus
  update job, and rolling one back change the statute/precedent text
  every downstream reasoning pipeline reads, and are deliberately not
  delegated beyond the tenant administrator. `auditor` holds
  `corpusupdater:view` (read-only access to jobs, staged/effective
  amendments, and their audit trail) consistent with its read-only,
  compliance-facing posture elsewhere in this matrix.
* `alerting:manage` (Phase 096, `packages/alerting`) is admin-only:
  registering or updating an alert rule, setting a tenant's escalation
  policy, and running a synthetic check on demand shape how (and
  whether) this platform pages a human when something goes wrong, and
  are deliberately not delegated beyond the tenant administrator.
  `auditor` holds `alerting:view` (read-only access to the alert-rule
  catalogue, fired alert-event history, escalation policies,
  dashboards, and synthetic-check results) consistent with its
  read-only, compliance-facing posture elsewhere in this matrix.
