# Verdex RBAC Permission Matrix

This document is generated from `packages/identity/permission.go` and
`packages/identity/role.go`. The permission matrix is the single source
of truth; this table is for human reference only.

A tick (✓) means the role holds that permission; a dash (–) means it
does not.

## Design notes

* Roles are additive. A user holding both `judge` and `clerk` has the
  union of both permission sets.
* `admin` does not imply judicial authority. An admin cannot issue case
  decisions (`case:sign_off`) unless they also hold the `judge` role.
* `auditor` is intentionally read-only across all dimensions. It cannot
  modify any data.
* `advocate` cannot schedule hearings — that is an administrative
  function performed by a clerk or judge.
* The permission matrix is enforced at runtime by
  `identity.HasPermission` and the `RequirePermission` HTTP middleware.
  The database layer (Row-Level Security, Phase 005) provides a
  second defence-in-depth layer against cross-tenant data access.
